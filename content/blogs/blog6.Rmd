# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

```{r}
glimpse(movies)
skim(movies)
movies %>%
group_by(genre) %>%
count(sort = TRUE)

gross_budget_by_genre <- movies %>% 
  select(genre, gross, budget)
Budget_by_genre <- aggregate(gross_budget_by_genre[ ,2:3],list(gross_budget_by_genre$genre), mean)

return_on_budget <- Budget_by_genre
return_on_budget$return <- return_on_budget$gross/return_on_budget$bud

get
print(return_on_budget)


```

```{r}
Director <- movies %>%
  select(director,gross)
Director_combined <- aggregate(Director$gross,list(Director$director), sum)
Director_Mean <- aggregate(Director$gross,list(Director$director), mean)
Director_combined$Mean <- Director_Mean[, 2]
Director_Stdev <- aggregate(Director$gross,list(Director$director), sd)
Director_combined$SD <- Director_Stdev[, 2]
Director_Median <- aggregate(Director$gross,list(Director$director), median)
Director_combined$Median <- Director_Median[, 2]

Director_combined <- Director_combined[with(Director_combined,order(-Director_combined$x)), ]
head(Director_combined,15)

```

## Facebook Likes vs. Gross Return
 
  It seems facebook likes related to the cast are not the primary determinant of how well a movie is going to gross at the box office.


```{r, gross_on_fblikes}

ggplot(movies, aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y=gross, color=genre)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~genre) + labs( x = " Cast Facebook Likes", y = " Gross Return")

```


## Budget vs Gross Return 
  
  At first glance when we compare budget to gross at the box office we see that there is a positive relationship, where movies with higher budgets tend to do better than those with low ones. However when we facet according to genre we observe that this relationship is far more pronounced in the action and adventure genres than in others. This is best explained by the fact that making an entertaining action movie costs more than making a good biography - a.k.a Michael Bay derives more marginal revenue for every marginal dollar spent on more explosives, than someone making a biography might. 

```{r, gross_on_budget}

ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, y=gross, color = genre)) + geom_point() 
ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, y=gross, color = genre)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~genre)


```

## Ratings vs. Gross Return
 
  We can see a positive, but not very clear relationship when it comes to ratings vs gross return at the box office. There are movies with high ratings making less than similar movies with lower ratings. This would lead us to conclude that ratings are also not the primary determinant of gross return on a movie. 

```{r, gross_on_rating}

ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating, y=gross, color = genre)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~genre) + labs( x = "IMDB Ratings", y = " Gross Returns")

```
